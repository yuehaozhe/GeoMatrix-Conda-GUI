## I. Visual Preview & 6 Core Features

Discover how GeoMatrix Studio transforms the cumbersome and inefficient management of Conda environments and GCP projects into an elegant and efficient engineering experience.

### A. Conda Visual Management

> **Encapsulate the lightning-fast Micromamba package management kernel within a pure, uncontaminated graphical sandbox.**


| Dimension                         | Traditional Conda CLI / Anaconda Navigator                                                                    | 🚀**GeoMatrix Studio (Micromamba Sandbox)**                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛠️ System Invasiveness           | ⚠️Automatically overwrites the global PATH, which can easily cause conflicts between multiple Python versions | ✅Fully sandboxed, uses temporary environment variables, leaving no trace on the system                    |
| 🧹 Installation and Cleanup       | ❌Uninstallation leaves behind large amounts of cache, configuration files, and unused packages                | ✨Folder-level data locking; one-click complete destruction leaves no junk files                           |
| 👁️ Package Information Awareness | ⚠️Command line displays only package names and versions; difficult to track size and licenses                 | ✅Visualized panoramic analysis provides an intuitive overview of the size and license of each dependency  |
| ⚡ User Experience                 | ❌High learning curve for the command line; Navigator launches slowly and is laggy                             | ✨Minimalist, modern UI with millisecond-level responsiveness; no need to memorize any terminal parameters |
